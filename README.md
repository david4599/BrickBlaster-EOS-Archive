## Description
This repository made for archival purposes contains the unmodified source code with built binaries of the game Brick Blaster (Media Pocket 1999) including WinEOS 4.00 Alpha as well as EOS 3.05 and 3.06.

This game was made using a custom DOS extender called EOS (Eclipse Operating System) which was adapted to make Windows applications with DirectX support hence WinEOS.

Note: The game source tree is not exactly matching the released version and some files need to be patched otherwise the game may crash in some cases.
The updated and patched version of the sources with detailed building steps can be found in this repository: [BrickBlaster](https://github.com/david4599/BrickBlaster)

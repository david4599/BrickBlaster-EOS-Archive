4. History
----------
20 Dec 94 : CDSRI is created by Hornet & Satanic that wanted to join their
    talent to produce a concrete stuff... Smells' coding starts.

Mar 95 : All Smells' code thrown to the bin, because it was too bad.
    Coding of new & cool effects starts.

Jul 95 : CDSRI moves to Useless, because CDSRI was an horrible name.
    Smells' main coding finished. <waiting for a soundsystem>
    Vector Engines coding starts, flat, gouraud...      

Jul-Aug 95 : Satanic works on Useless Module Player.

Sep 95 : Hornet & Satanic go to high school : time for coding decreases
    dangerously.

Oct 95 : Hornet starts coding Useless Vector Editor.

30 Dec 95 : We decide to finish off this #{&* fucking demo in a few days.

1 Jan 96 : "Smells like Amiga spirit" name found by a friend : Bart.

2 Jan 96 : Smells' v1.0 finished, but bugged : does not work without
    soundcard, bugs with SBx

Dec 95/Jan 96 : coding of a new demo starts, to bring to ASM'96 : for the
    moment it may be coded all in asm with dos32v32, and the target computer
    is a pentium 120 (i.e. it will be at full framerate, 70 frames a second,
    on this computer)
                                                        
26 Jan 96 : New members join! Index, YannSulu & JBT...

Feb 96 : our Internet Page is ready, Index is op. at :
           http://193.54.10.242/~montasma/main.html

14 Mar 96 : Another new member! yahoo! FreddyV (ModMaster's author)

Mar 96 : We'll have a nice XM player, FreddyV 's coding it right now!

9 Apr 96 : Two young musicians, -M- & PSL, join to compose music, great!

11 Apr 96 : An Amiga graphician, Rafale, accepts to draw for us, yeah...

June 96 : first Phong using EnvMap from Satanic...

July 96 : We can't go to Asm'96, fuck... goin' to Wired'96?

August 96 : E.O.S. is quicker than DOS32!

5 Aug 96 : release of "Alix le chien con v1.0"... a 6-hours-nighty delirium
    Anyway, music is poor and a big part in french, there's an anim, code is
    not-so-good...

Summer 96 : definatelly YannSulu, JBT & Rafale can't be said as being really
    in the group...

Sept 96 : Yes, we'll go to the Wired, rather we won't have a demo ready or
    not... in fact we've got to meet to plan something really cool for mid-97

Oct 96 : Bart finds again a name for our next demo : Use (it) as an illusion

Nov 96 : FreddyV finished off his xm player, supporting gus and sb, EOS and
    DOS32, soon available on the Internet
    
Apr 97 : FreddyV finished the release 1.0 of his XM player for EOS, DOS32 and
    watcom C/C++... sure you'll like the ultimate player of the scene!
